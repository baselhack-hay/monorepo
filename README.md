## Basic Structure

The application is structured into two main features / sections.
1. A *community* feed
2. An *inner circles*

### Community
The community part has a feed with *posts* which can be created by every user anonimously. Every other user can reply with a *comment* and discuss the post with the creator and other users.

### Inner Circles
In the inner circles part users can create *groups* with other users. Every group has a *daily question* which needs to be answered in order to access the *chat* of a group. The chat is used to discuss the *answers* for daily questions and also go deeper on any topic in a safe space only shared with members of the group.
